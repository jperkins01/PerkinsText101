    until reaching what looked like a cell door. You slide the cell door open and
    on the other side there was a staircase which lead to a door with a sign that
    read \"EXIT\". You take the door and are now outside and free from the tunnels.\r\n\rWould
    you like to play again?\n1. Yes, lets do it! \n2. No, i'm good.\n\r"
