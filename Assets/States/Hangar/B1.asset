  storyText: "After choosing the path to the left, you walk down a dark tunnel with
    nothing but sounds of dripping water until reaching a wall. \n\nOn the wall there
    is a space small enough to crawl through and on another wall there is a scary
    looking door. \r\n\nYou must choose to either crawl through the crawl space or
    go through the door.\r\n\r\nWhat would you like to do?\r\n1. Crawl through the
    crawl space\r\n2. Go through the door"
